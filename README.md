You are required to generate a prediction of the total amount to sell during the year
2024-09-01 â†’ 2025-08-31 for each brand+family. The goal of this prediction is to generate a
budget (per brand+family) for the purchasing team.  

You are given two data files, one with information about products, and another containing
historic sales data.  

Please hand in one (or several, if required) ipynb file with the data exploration, modelling
and outcome analysis; and a data file with the generated predictions.  

The developed ML solution does not need to be finetuned, since the goal is to evaluate your
approach to the process, not the specific result.  

Then answer the following questions:  
1. What metric have you used and why have you selected this particular metric? Is
there any drawback that comes from using this metric?  
2. What error can we expect from the generated predictions? How many units do you
estimate will be left unsold at the end of the year? How can we minimize this?  
3. If you had the time to develop this project further, what improvements would you
consider testing?  
4. How would you make these predictions available to the purchasing team? Please
write a few pros and cons of every alternative proposed.  
5. How would you evaluate the performance of this model in production? How would
you justify those numbers to the purchasing team?  
6. If there is any pandemic or economical crisis, which strategy would you propose to
make sure the model can be adapted to it?
